## Bike Tracker

This is an app designed to track the status of Divvy shared bicycles in Chicago,
focusing on several locations of interest, and showing bike status in a mobile-friendly way.

## Technology

The app uses Spring Boot to power a basic Java webapp. The app downloads a JSON 
file with details on bike and dock status, and formats it for easy use. Bootstrap, 
Font Awesome, and metro-bootstrap styles are then used to present the data
in an intuitive, mobile-friendly way.

The app is deployed to Heroku, but could be deployed almost anywhere.
