## Bike Tracker

This is an app designed to track the status of Divvy shared bicycles in Chicago,
focusing on several locations of interest, and showing bike status in a mobile-friendly way.

## Technology

The app uses Spring Boot to power a very basic Java webapp.
Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and the metro-bootstrap style are used for presentation.

The app is deployed to Heroku, but could be deployed almost anywhere.
